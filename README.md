# Baymax-Patch-toOls

1. Baymax Patch Tools releases a hijacked DLL for the target process to load the functional module PYG.DLL, realizing dynamic patching of the target process. it not only supports dynamically modifying instructions and data of the target module, but also simulates the OD break function, which can modify the corresponding registers, flag registers and memory data of the registers pointing to memory after breaking the target module, so as to achieve cracking it without modifying the target file.
2. It supports the following two kinds of patching functions: Search and Replace Patch, which can directly modify the instruction code or memory data in the process memory by locating the memory address through the feature code or offset address. Exception Breakpoint Patch, support the abnormal interrupt function of the simulated debugger, by setting and triggering the interrupt after modifying registers, memory and other data to achieve the purpose of modifying the program execution process and so on.
3. The tool is protected by a shell, and the antivirus may misreport the tool and the patch file! Due to the use of the shell SDK, all components of the tool (including the generated patches) do not contain networking capabilities! The generated patches will not modify any files in the system when running (except for overwriting patch files). The generated patches will not modify any files in the system when running (except for overwriting patch files). The tool itself has a verification mechanism and will load only after the module is successfully verified at startup, but for security reasons, please be sure to download and use it from the official site.

# Function introduction
